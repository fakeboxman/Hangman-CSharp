# Hangman – C# Console Game

This is a simple Hangman game I made to practice C# programming concepts, while I was studying *The C# Player’s Guide*. I built it myself to practice working with strings, loops, and user input in the console.

## Features
- Random word chosen from a built-in list
- Player guesses letters using keyboard input
- Shows correctly guessed letters and keeps track of wrong guesses
- 5 allowed wrong guesses before game over
- Shows win or lose message

## What I learned
- Working with strings and char arrays
- Using lists to store history of guesses
- Handling console input and output
- Basic game logic and loops

## How to run
2. Run with `dotnet run`
3. Use keyboard letters to guess the word
